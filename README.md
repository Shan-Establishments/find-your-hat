# Find Your Hat ðŸŽ©

I completed this project independently via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path), where I built an interactive terminal game. In this game the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field to win the game you must find that hat.
