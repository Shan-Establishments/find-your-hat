# Find Your Hat GameðŸŽ©

I completed this project independently via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

This is an interactive terminal dependent mini game. In this game the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes (*looks like this* > 0), and they must navigate back to the hat (*looks like this* > ^) without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field to win the game.

### Technologies used:
+ Javascript
+ Node.js
+ Command Line


### How to play the game
**Please note you will have a better compatibility with the Git Command Line**

1. You will have to use the keyboard to navigate through the game in order to get the hat, the keys you should use are U, D, L and R which stands for Up, Down, Left and Right (in that order). If however you do not use the keys specified, you will end up with this:

2. Once you started navigating through the game, you can see how far you progressed by looking at the amount of asterisks there are like so:

3. But you must be careful as once you have fallen into a hole or out of bounds it is game over!

4. If you managed to find your hat you have won the game.

Once you finished the game you have the option of starting again, the location of the hat and the amount of holes there is is randomly generated so you are able to play the game how many times you want.
